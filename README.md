## BAHRAIN VAT management and reporting - ERPNext module.

This is minor tweak of E-invoing done on ( https://github.com/ahmadpak/ksa_vat ) for Bahrain. Full credit goes to Havenir Solutions who has done most of the coding. 

VAT and E-invoicing are mostly same across the Gulf, because of implementaion of taxation is a GCC decision. However there are minor changes required, we at ERPGulf working with our partners and clients to accomodate such changes and publish it for the community to use.

We will soon publish VAT modules for other Gulf countries like Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. ( VAT is not implemented in Qatar as of now ) . UAE and Saudi VAT modules are already available with ERPNext core.

Note: Multiple Item Tax Templates can be set for each item.

A good example in the sales would be an item that is treated as a standard rated Sales and as well as Zero-rated domestic sales. The same case can be applied to the purchase cycle.
